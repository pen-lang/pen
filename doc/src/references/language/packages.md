# Packages

Packages are sets of modules. They are built by the `pen build` command as applications or libraries depending on their configurations.

## What composes a package?

The following entities can compose packages.

- Repositories of version control systems (VCS)
  - Currently, only [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is supported as a VCS.
- Directories with [package configuration files](#package-configuration) on file systems
- Standard packages that come with the `pen` command
  - They have a special protocol scheme of `pen` if imported in package configuration files.

## Kinds of packages

There are two kinds of packages: applications and libraries.

Application packages build applications that are often executable files on host platforms. Library packages are meant to be imported and used by other packages which can be of both applications and libraries.

Packages are considered to be of applications if they have `Main.pen` files at their top directories. Otherwise, they are library ones.

Note that every application package needs to have a system package entry named `System` in their [package configuration files](#package-configuration).

## Package configuration

Each package has its configuration file named `pen.json` in a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format at its top directory. The JSON file has a single field named `dependencies` specifying package names and URLs to their locations.

Package URLs have different protocol schemes depending on where they are located.

- Git repositories: `git`
- Directories on file systems: `file`
- Standard packages: `pen`

### Examples

#### Application

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "System": "pen:///lib/os",
    "Core": "pen:///lib/core",
    "MyLibrary": "git://github.com/john-doe/super-hello-world"
  }
}
```

#### Library

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "Core": "pen:///lib/core",
    "MyLibrary": "git://github.com/john-doe/super-hello-world"
  }
}
```
