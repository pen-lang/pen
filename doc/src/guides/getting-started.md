# Getting started

## Install

See [Install](install).

## Creating a package

To create your first package, run the following command.

```sh
pen create foo
```

Then, you should see a `foo` directory under your current directory. When you switch to the `foo` directory, you should see a `Main.pen` source file and a `pen.json` package configuration file there.

## Building a package

To build the package, run the following command in the `foo` directory.

```sh
pen build
```

Then, you will see an executable file named `app` in the directory. Run it to see your first "Hello, world!"

```sh
./app
```

## For more information...

Now, you can start editing `*.pen` files and build your own application!
