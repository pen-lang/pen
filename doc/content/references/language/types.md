### Literals

- Fields are private outside modules where they are defined.
- Append a suffix of a field name to an expression of a record type to access its value.

```
person{name: "foo", age: 42}
person{...john, name: "bar"}
john.name
```

```

### Literals

- Their values can be referenced as variables of their names.

```
foo
```

## Unions

- Unions combine different types into a type.

```
foo | bar
```

## Any

- `any` is something called a "top" type.
- Any types can be casted to `any` type.

```
any
```
