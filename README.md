Pen is a **functional** programming language focused on **application programming** following [Go][go]'s philosophy. It aims for further simplicity, testability, and portability to empower team (v. individual) and/or long-term (v. short-term) productivity.

Pen's system libraries and runtime are detachable from applications and it can compile the same applications even for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [WASI](https://wasi.dev/). Pen also provides [Rust][rust]/C FFI to reuse existing resources written in those languages.

```pen
import Os'Context { Context }
import Os'File
import Os'Process

sayHello = \(ctx Context) none | error {
  File'Write(ctx, File'StdOut(), "Hello, world!\n")?

  none
}

main = \(ctx context) none {
  e = sayHello(ctx.Os)

  if _ = e as none {
    none
  } else if error {
    Process'Exit(ctx.Os, 1)
  }
}
```

## Install

Pen is available via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install pen-lang/pen/pen

The `\` (lambda, Î») notation in function types and literals originates from other functional programming languages like [Haskell](https://haskell.org).

## Technical design

### Context switch

Like [Go][go], every function in Pen is suspendable and can be called asynchronously. This is realized by intermediate representation compiled into [Continuation Passing Style (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) which also enables proper tail calls. Thus, Pen implements context switch without any platform-dependent codes for slight sacrifice of performance while Go requires logic written in assembly languages.

Currently, Pen does not use [delimited continuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimited_continuation) for the following reasons.

- Traditional continuations are sufficient for our use cases, such as asynchronous programming.
- Delimited continuations require heap allocations although the second-class continuations do not.

### Reference counting GC

Pen implements [the Perceus reference counting][perceus] as its GC. Thanks to the state-of-the-art ownership-based RC algorithm, programs written in Pen performs much less than traditional RC where every data transfer or mutation requires counting operations. In addition, the algorithm reduces heap allocations significantly for records behind unique references, which brings practical performance without introducing unsafe mutability.
