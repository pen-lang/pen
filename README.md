Pen is the programming language that makes software development **scalable**, focusing on software maintainability and portability.

```pen
import System'Context { Context }
import System'File

sayHello = \(ctx Context) none | error {
  File'Write(ctx, File'StdOut(), "Hello, world!\n")?

  none
}

main = \(ctx Context) number {
  e = sayHello(ctx)

  if e = e as none {
    0
  } else if error {
    1
  }
}
```

## Vision

Pen aims to make large-scale software development efficient where a number of people develop software together. To realize that, it focuses on software **maintainability** and **portability**.

- Maintainability
  - Simplicity: The language is small and easy to learn but also full featured.
  - Testability: Unit tests are always reliable, fast, and independent with each other.
  - Modifiability: Developers can change application logic without changing implementation details, and vice versa.
- Portability
  - Programs written in the language can be ported to different platforms including [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

## Features

### Minimal language

- Its [syntax][syntax] and [type system](https://pen-lang.org/references/language/types.html) are small, simple, and easy to learn.
- Yet, the language supports all the modern features, such as:
  - Functional programming
  - Effect system
  - Dependency injection
  - Asynchronous operations
  - Parallel computation

### Deterministic testing

- All unit tests are deterministic.
- Therefore, testing is always reliable and fast.
- You never get bothered by flaky or slow tests.

### System injection

- [System injection](https://pen-lang.org/advanced-features/system-injection.html) is a novel mechanism to isolate application logic from implementation details.
- The language injects system functions into applications explicitly.
- Developers can even define their own system functions.

### Others

- Static typing
- Immutable values
- Pure functions by default
- Errors as values (no runtime error)
- Cross compile
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)/C foreign function interface

### Work in progress...

#### Asynchronous operation

Functions can be called asynchronously to run multiple tasks concurrently.

#### Parallel computation

The runtime and library provide tools for thread-safe parallel computation that leverage multi-core CPUs.
