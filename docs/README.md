# Pen

The functional programming language for scalable development

## Goals

Pen is designed for software developed by a large number of people and/or over a long period of time.

To make such development efficient, it focuses on:

- Simplicity
  - Its syntax and type system are simple and easy to learn.
  - Its minimal language features keep codes maintainable.
- Portability
  - Software written in the language can be:
    - Ported to different platforms including operating systems, web browsers and [WASI](https://wasi.dev/). (WIP)
    - Reused by other languages via FFI.

## Features

- Statically typed
- Immutable values
- Pure functions by default
- No runtime error
- Parallel computation (WIP)
- Thread safety (WIP)
