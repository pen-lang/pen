// Function definitions in let-recursive expressions are recursive for the
// following reasons although we don't have any recursive function
// definitions in practice.
//
// - Variants of typed lambda calculus used in other languages like OCaml are
//   also implemented like this.
// - In reference counting, we need to access closure objects inside their
//   functions themselves to drop them properly because they are moved into
//   function calls.
//   - This requirement can be potentially removed by dropping every functions
//     used in function calls inside the functions themselves.
//     - This is safe because only global function definitions can be recursive.
// - This recursion is necessary to compile "anonymous" loops in HIR
//   effectively.
//   - e.g. list comprehension
