[features]
# This feature enables client libraries to use the exactly same rutnime of Tokio 
# in resulting binaries.
# Otherwise, we might instantiate two different versions of Tokio runtimes there.
# For example, we might have multiple global variables of async contexts named 
# with different symbols in TLS, which fails asynchronous function calls due to 
# uninitialized contexts.
