Feature: Generating documentation for a package
  Background:
    Given a file named "pen.json" with:
    """json
    {
      "type": "library",
      "dependencies": {}
    }
    """

  Scenario: Generate documentation for a package
    Given a file named "Foo.pen" with:
    """pen
    # Do something nice.
    Foo = \() none {
      none
    }
    """
    When I run the following script:
    """sh
    pen document \
      --name Foo \
      --url https://github.com/foo/foo \
      --description "This package is cool." \
      > Foo.md
    """
    Then a file named "Foo.md" should contain "`Foo` package"
