Feature: Standard packages
  Scenario Outline: Build and test standard packages
    Given I run the following script:
    """
    cp -r $PEN_ROOT/packages .
    """
    When I cd to "packages/<package>"
    Then I successfully run `pen format --check`
    And I successfully run `pen build`
    And I successfully run `pen test`

    Examples:
      | package      |
      | core         |
      | http         |
      | json         |
      | os           |
      | os-sync      |
      | sql          |
      | test         |
